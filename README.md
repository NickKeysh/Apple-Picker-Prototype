# Apple-Picker-Prototype
The Apple Picker Prototype was created from the book "Unity and C#. Gamedev from idea to implementation" [Jeremy Gibson].
In this prototype, the player controls three baskets and catches apples from the tree, earning points. If a player misses an apple, then one basket is lost. When a player loses all baskets the game ends.
